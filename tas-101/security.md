# Security Documentation

PWS implements the following measures to mitigate against security threats:

- Minimizes network surface area
- Isolates customer apps and data in containers
- Encrypts connections
- Uses role-based access controls, applying and enforcing roles and permissions to ensure that users can only view and affect the spaces for which they have been granted access
- Ensures security of app bits in a multi-tenant environment
- Prevents possible denial of service attacks through resource starvation
